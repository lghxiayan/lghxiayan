TODO
- fix SetPushedTexture for targetted unit
- add code to alter update frequency
- option to only show GUI when in raid

	
SUGGESTIONS:
- modify class/party/... priorities via a set of sliders (AceGUI2?)
- move communication to library with unified API for heal tracking mods
- reverse healthbar direction
- pink < for party member and highest priority combination
- light green H for unit player is healing

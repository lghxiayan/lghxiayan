# Python GUIs Examples

**This repository contains 100s of GUI examples written in Python**. From complete working applications to reusable widgets snippets, these examples can
be _freely_ re-used, re-mixed and tweaked to build your own Python GUI applications.

Examples are available for
[PyQt6](https://github.com/pythonguis/15-minute-apps/tree/master/pyqt6),
[PySide6](https://github.com/pythonguis/15-minute-apps/tree/master/pyside6),
[PySide2](https://github.com/pythonguis/15-minute-apps/tree/master/pyside2)
and [PyQt5](https://github.com/pythonguis/15-minute-apps/tree/master/pyqt5)

> Many of these examples have more detailed write-ups on the [Python GUIs website](https://www.pythonguis.com/). If you're new to creating GUI apps check out the introductory [PyQt6 tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt6-tutorial/) or [PySide6 tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyside6-tutorial/).

## The demo apps

The apps showcase various parts of the Qt framework, including advanced widgets,
multimedia, graphics views and decorationless windows. However, the most
generally interesting/feature complete applications are Minesweeper, Solitaire
and Paint.

## The tutorials

As well as the complete apps & re-usable widgets we've got selection of code snippets taken from tutorials on the [Python GUIs](https://www.pythonguis.com) website. These guide you through building GUIs with PyQt, PySide and other libraries.

## Getting started

To use each app you first need to install the requirements. In most cases
the only requirements are the GUI library and occasionally requests. To install
example specific requirements change to the folder of the example and run:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Once the requirements are installed, you can run the app. Every example in this repo comes with a main Python file called `main.py` to keep things simple.

    python3 main.py

The application window should appear.

## Want to build your own apps?

> If you think these apps are neat and want to learn more about
take a look at my [PyQt6 tutorial](https://www.pythonguis.com/pyqt6-tutorial)
which covers everything you need to know to start building your own applications with Python.

You can also find more write-ups and tips [on the same site](http://www.pythonguis.com/).

## License

All code is **licensed under an MIT license**. This allows you to re-use the code freely, remixed in both commercial and non-commercial projects. The only requirement is to include the same license when distributing.
